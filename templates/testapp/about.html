        <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong>
        
        <h1 id="info">
            <p>As a Python Full-Stack Web Developer, I have worked on both front-end and back-end aspects of web development. For the front-end, I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have used these technologies to design responsive and user-friendly interfaces, ensuring that the web applications are both functional and visually appealing. I also have experience working with front-end frameworks like React and Bootstrap to build dynamic and interactive websites.</p>

            <p>On the back-end side, I have strong experience working with Python, particularly with Django. I have developed RESTful APIs using Django's REST framework and integrated them with front-end technologies. I am comfortable working with databases, and I have used both SQL (SQLite, Mysql) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases to store and manage data efficiently. In my projects, I have implemented various features such as user authentication, form validations.</p>
            I have also worked with Git for version control, ensuring that the code is maintained properly. I am always learning and keeping up with the latest technologies to improve my skills as a full-stack developer.
